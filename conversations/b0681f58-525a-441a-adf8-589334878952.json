  "message": "When handling sensitive documents with private information, it is important to ensure that the documents are kept secure and confidential. This can be done by storing the documents in a secure location, such as a locked filing cabinet or a secure server, and by limiting access to the documents to only those who need it. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the documents are disposed of securely when no longer needed.",
