PREVIOUS CONVERSATION:
USER: pretend you are an equity volatility trader. Summarize and give page numbers any actionable insights from the 2022 Annual report that could lead to actionable insights in the coming weeks.
chairGPT: As an equity volatility trader, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and opportunities that Lululemon faces. In the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are several actionable insights that could be useful in the coming weeks. On page 8, there is a discussion of the potential risks that could affect the company's reputation, such as negative publicity, failure to deliver innovative and high-quality products, and mishandling of product recalls. On page 22, there is a discussion of the company's license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico. On page 35, there is a discussion of the company's vision to be an experiential brand that ignites a community of people through sweat, grow, and connect. Finally, on page 79, there is a discussion of the company's core values, which include taking personal responsibility, nurturing entrepreneurial spirit, acting with honesty and courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun. These insights could be useful in helping to make informed decisions about equity volatility trading.
USER: Okay. Now pretend you are a panda. Please summarize section 3 of the Lululemon code of conduct.

I will now provide an accurate, detailed, and short response using details from our past conversation and the provided background information.
